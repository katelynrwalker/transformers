ARTICLE = "What is claimed is:  1. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), comprising:  a frame; a propulsion device attached to the frame; and a management device in communication with the propulsion device and configured to:  receive a control signal from a controller, the control signal at least comprising a signal capable of controlling the propulsion device; receive a first heartbeat signal, the first heartbeat signal and subsequent heartbeat signals expected to be received by the management device according to a fixed interval; detect that a second heartbeat signal was not received by the management device according to the fixed interval; and at least in response to the detecting, initiate a safety protocol comprising instructions for the management device to perform one or more safety actions.    2. The UAV of claim 1 , wherein the management device is further configured to, in response to receiving the first heartbeat signal, send a first response signal to the controller, the second heartbeat signal provided by the controller in response to receiving the first response signal.  3. The UAV of claim 1 , wherein receiving the first heartbeat signal comprises receiving the first heartbeat signal from the controller or receiving the first heart beat signal from a device included on the UAV and managed by the management device.  4. The UAV of claim 1 , wherein the one or more safety actions comprise at least one of autonomous navigation of the UAV to a safe location, autonomous navigation of the UAV to an authentication location, or autonomous hovering of the UAV for a certain period of time.  5. A computer-implemented method, comprising:  receiving, at an aerial device and at a first time, first information of a set of information expected according to a communication scheme; determining, based at least in part on the communication scheme, that second information of the set of information expected at a second time was not received, the second time occurring after the first time; and in response to determining that the second information was not received, generating an alarm signal.   6. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 , further comprising receiving a set of control signals from a controller, the set of control signals comprising at least one signal capable of controlling a propulsion device of the aerial device.  7. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 , wherein:  the method further comprises, after receiving the first information, setting a timer for a period of time; and determining that the second information expected at the second time was not received comprises determining that the second information was not received within the period of time.   8. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 , wherein the alarm signal causes the aerial device to perform a safety action comprising at least one of:  hovering for a period of time corresponding to the communication scheme to receive third information of the set of information expected at a third time occurring after the second time; sending a reconnection signal to a controller; changing the communication scheme according to which the set of information is expected; changing a channel on which control signals are received from the controller; navigation of the aerial device to a predefined safe location; determination by the aerial device of a safe location and navigation of the aerial device to the safe location; navigation of the aerial device to a home location; or navigation of the aerial device to an authentication location.   9. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 , wherein:  the alarm signal causes an error state in the aerial device; and the method further comprises:  at least in response to generating the alarm signal, causing the aerial device to navigate to an authentication location; and causing the aerial device to perform an authentication technique while at the authentication location, successful performance of the authentication technique resetting the error state in the aerial device and causing a change to at least one signal characteristic of control signals that control the aerial device.    10. The computer-implemented method of claim 9 , wherein the authentication technique comprises detecting, by the aerial device and using an imaging device on the aerial device, light information projected from the authentication location.  11. The computer-implemented method of claim 10 , wherein the light information is spatially arranged or temporally modulated.  12. The computer-implemented method of claim 9 , wherein the at least one signal characteristic comprises a channel, an encryption technique, or a transmission rate.  13. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 , wherein the set of information is:  received from a device included on the aerial device and configured to output the set of information according to the communication scheme; or transmitted from a controller comprising at least one of a manual control device or an aerial device management system.   14. The computer-implemented method of claim 5 , wherein the set of information comprises a set of signals transmitted to the aerial device as a continuous transmission.  15. A computer-implemented method, comprising:  receiving, at an aerial device, a first heartbeat signal from a controller, the first heartbeat signal comprising information about a safe location; and in the event a second heartbeat signal is not received from the controller within a predetermined time after receiving the first beat signal, causing the aerial device to navigate to the safe location.   16. The computer-implemented method of claim 15 , wherein the information about the safe location comprises at least one of an identifier usable by the aerial device to access geographic information about the safe location from a database associated with the aerial device or a geographic identifier that identifies a geographic location corresponding to the safe location.  17. The computer-implemented method of claim 15 , wherein:  the information comprises other information about other safe locations; and the method further comprises, prior to causing the aerial device to navigate to the safe location, selecting the safe location from among a set of safe locations comprising the safe location and the other safe locations.   18. The computer-implemented method of claim 17 , wherein selecting the safe location is based at least in part on a selection factor comprising at least one of:  a proximity factor indicating a proximity of individual safe locations of the set of safe locations to a current location of the aerial device; or a classification factor indicating a landing class of the individual safe locations of the set of safe locations.   19. The computer-implemented method of claim 15 , wherein:  the safe location is a first safe location; and the method further comprises, prior to receiving the first heartbeat signal from the controller, receiving a third heartbeat signal from the controller, the third heartbeat signal comprising information about a third safe location.   20. The computer-implemented method of claim 15 , wherein:  the method further comprises receiving a set of control signals from the controller, the set of control signals comprising at least one signal capable of controlling a propulsion device of the aerial device; and causing the aerial device to navigate to the safe location comprises controlling the propulsion device without use of control signals of the set of control signals."
